# PKC
A parallel k-core decomposition (PKC) algorithm on Multicore Platforms for large sparse graphs.


Compiling the program:
    
    $ cd /PKC/
    $ make 
    By default, Intel's icc compiler is used. gcc compiler can also be used. To use gcc, please change the Makefile 
    to include -fopenmp flag.
    
    
Input Format:


    The input to the program is a text file. The file should contain an undirected graph and vertex should start from 0. 
    The first line contains the number of vertices(N) and number of edges(M). Next M lines contain the M edges. Please check 
    the example.txt file for an example graph.
    
Execution:


    The program can be executed using the following command:
    $ OMP_NUM_THREADS=p ./pkc.exe graph.txt

    where, p is the number of threads used and graph.txt is a file containing a sparse graph. By default the number of threads is 1.
